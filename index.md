> "After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own" (John 19:27 DRB).  
> "Deinde dicit discipulo : Ecce mater tua. Et ex illa hora accepit eam discipulus in sua" (Vulgate).

Before his death, Jesus Christ presents the disciple whom he loves so much the great gift of his very mother. This mother's soul, pure and immaculate, is being pierced by a sword as she sorrowfully witnesses the death of her divine son on the cross. This mother who on the first Christmas so joyfully and tenderly held her new-born son now beholds the spectacle of the cross.

At the Cross her station keeping,              Stabat mater dolorósa  
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,             juxta Crucem lacrimósa,  
Close to Jesus to the last:                    dum pendébat Fílius.  

Through her heart, his sorrow sharing,         Cuius ánimam geméntem,  
All his bitter anguish bearing,                contristántem et doléntem  
now at length the sword has pass'd.            pertransívit gládius.  

Oh, how sad and sore distress'd                O quam tristis et afflícta  
Was that Mother highly blest                   fuit illa benedícta,  
Of the sole-begotten One!                      mater Unigéniti!  

Christ above in torment hangs;                 Quae mœrébat et dolébat,  
She beneath beholds the pangs                  pia Mater, dum vidébat  
Of her dying glorious Son.                     nati pœnas ínclyti.  

Is there one who would not weep,               Quis est homo qui non fleret,  
Whelm'd in miseries so deep,                   matrem Christi si vidéret  
Christ's dear Mother to behold?                in tanto supplício?  

Can the human heart refrain                    Quis non posset contristári  
From partaking in her pain,                    Christi Matrem contemplári  
In that Mother's pain untold?                  doléntem cum Fílio?  

Bruis'd, derided, curs'd, defil'd,             Pro peccátis suæ gentis  
She beheld her tender Child                    vidit Jésum in torméntis,  
All with bloody scourges rent;                 et flagéllis súbditum.  

For the sins of his own nation,                Vidit suum dulcem Natum  
Saw Him hang in desolation,                    moriéndo desolátum,
Till His Spirit forth He sent.                 dum emísit spíritum.
