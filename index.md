> "After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own" (John 19:27 DRB).

Before his death, Jesus Christ presents the disciple whom he loves so much the great gift of his very mother. This mother's soul, pure and immaculate, is being pierced by a sword as she sorrowfully witnesses the death of her divine son on the cross. This mother who on the first Christmas so joyfully and tenderly held her new-born son now beholds the spectacle of the cross.

At the Cross her station keeping,              Stabat mater dolorósa  
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,             juxta Crucem lacrimósa,  
Close to Jesus to the last:                    dum pendébat Fílius.

Through her heart, his sorrow sharing,         Cuius ánimam geméntem,
All his bitter anguish bearing,                contristántem et doléntem
now at length the sword has pass'd.            pertransívit gládius.

Oh, how sad and sore distress'd                O quam tristis et afflícta
Was that Mother highly blest                   fuit illa benedícta,
Of the sole-begotten One!  

Christ above in torment hangs;  
She beneath beholds the pangs  
Of her dying glorious Son.  

Is there one who would not weep,  
Whelm'd in miseries so deep,  
Christ's dear Mother to behold?  

Can the human heart refrain  
From partaking in her pain,  
In that Mother's pain untold?  

Bruis'd, derided, curs'd, defil'd,  
She beheld her tender Child  
All with bloody scourges rent;  

For the sins of his own nation,
Saw Him hang in desolation,
Till His Spirit forth He sent.
